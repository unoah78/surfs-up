# The results from the two tables above show the following:
- Weather is consistent from June through December
  - Average temparture for June is *75* degrees with December coming in at *71* degrees (*4* degrees difference).
  - Max temparture in June is *85* degrees with December coming in at *83* degrees (*2* degrees difference).
  - Minimum temparture in June is *64* and December was *56* degrees.

## Summary

Based on the rich tradition of surfing in Hawaii on top of the findings through analizing Oahu weather patterns, the idea of opening a surf shop in Oahu appears to be a good idea. Through the December month I would also suggest stocking up on some full wet-suits when the water temperature drops down to *56* degrees.
